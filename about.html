		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Imagine walking down the street and getting a notification from your phone or tablet. CoffeeBear, our app, tells you that there is a beacon-enabled coffee shop&mdash;a virtual salon&mdash;nearby.</p>
		<p>In the close perimeter of the coffee shop the discussion can be accessed; you watch a few video portraits, people reflecting on the subject, and enter the café. When you enter you order a cup of coffee, a bit more pricey, perhaps, but not much, the fact that you just bought a 5 dollar cup of coffee. In buying the coffee you gain access to a specially curated selection of articles on the topic special to this particular café. The curator could be an editor of a large newspaper. The extra money you paid for your coffee went to those curating this "salon".</p>
		<p>After you have read your articles, browsed a few video portraits, you feel like participating. You turn on your phone or possibly enter the dedicated "speakers corner" and film yourself making your comment. You think twice before you speak, as you would when engaging in a discussion in real life. Since you cannot hide, talking to the camera makes you feel slightly vulnerable, but then again, your submission will only stay in this context, as a part of a discussion tied to a this "salon".</p>
		<p>You browse app and find a quiz on the subject. You play around and then you continue exploring the app, where you find the multimedia documentary. It tells the story of the French salons, the Tischgesellschaften, the coffeeshops of England. Spaces where people met to discuss and exchange ideas over tea and coffee. It introduces you the concept of the public sphere, the rise of mass media media, the art of conversation and dialogue, the internet and so on. The story puts your experience into context, and possibly changes your experience and vice versa.</p>
		<p>What you have taken part in is virtual salon; beacon-enabled cafés connecting a virtual space with a geographical space.</p>
